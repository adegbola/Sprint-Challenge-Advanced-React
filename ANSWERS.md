- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?


1. Class components are allowed to fetch data plus handle changes unlike our easy to write fuctional components.

2. My three lifecycle methods I've used just recently is the contructor method which holds props then usually for me intitlizes the state. You can even base the props if you choose depends on situtaion.
Second is the most commonly known and used which is the render method and this used to display/ "render" your beautiful JSX.
Third is another one of my favorites and that is componentDidMount which is used to load/fectch your DATA!

3. A custom is hook is used to reuse stateful logic. Such as react-use-form-state hook which to me is most effiecient way to keep track of your forms state better than Formik.

4. Last but not least the reason we test our React Apps is to make sure the app is running to best of its ability and if there needs to be any changes, updates or bug fixes tests will help you deep dive and find what you need! Never such thing as too many tests, unless they're completely unecessary.
